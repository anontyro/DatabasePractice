# Database Practice (MYSQL)

After I completed my Java course I was still lacking in database experience and as a result I created this project.
This is a basic implementation for a POS system that has a Swing GUI implemented over the top, a lot of the pages
are generated dynamically and the buttons are pulled from the database to create an array of buttons that will alter 
depedant on the situation.

The project is largely unfinished but a lot of the implmentation does work and preforms the tasks of displaying the data,
although the  logic to drive the system is not implemented.

This project taught me a great deal about SQL databases and was the foundation of my database knowledge.
